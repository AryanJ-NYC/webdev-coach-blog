I completed a video series where I recorded the steps necessary to create a Random Quote Machine. The Random Quote Machine is created using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and deployed with [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

# Set Up Environment

In the first video, I set up the local environment, including the FreeCodeCamp test suite. I use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the application.

# Begin Development

In the second video, I begin to develop the application. Specifically, I added a button with an event handler.

# Fetch and Render a Quote

In the third video, I use the `fetch()` API to make a GET request and fetch quotes from a [JSON file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/natebass/b0a548425a73bdf8ea5c618149fe1fce/raw/f4231cd5961f026264bb6bb3a6c41671b044f1f4/quotes.json). I introduce React lifecycle methods. A quote is rendered and displayed to the browser.

# Choose a Random Quote on Button Click

In the fourth video, a new quote is rendered when our button is pressed.

# Add Styling with Help of Material-UI

In the fifth video, I use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) to style the Random Quote Machine.

# Add Tweet Link to Application and Pass FreeCodeCamp Test Suite

In the sixth video, I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) to render a Twitter icon. This icon allows the user to tweet a quote when clicked.

# Deploy Random Quote Machine to Netlify

In the seventh and final video, I deploy the Random Quote Machine to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
